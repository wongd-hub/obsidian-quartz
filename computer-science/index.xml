base-2 Our everyday number system is a decimal-based (i.e. base-10) one. Take the number 123 for example, we can think of this as 1 in the 100s slot, 2 in the 10s slot, 3 in the 1s slot; adding them we get 123 Generalising this, each of those slots is 10 to the power of something: $100 = 10^2, 10 = 10^1, 1 = 10^0$ If we wanted to switch to a binary system, i.</description></item><item><title>Bitmap</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Bitmap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Bitmap/</guid><description>#course_cs50

We&amp;rsquo;ve seen that we can use numeric addresses to represent addresses in memory with [[Memory#Pointers|pointers]].
Since these addresses are numeric, we can do something called pointer arithmetic to manipulate them.</description></item><item><title>Pseudocode</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Pseudocode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Pseudocode/</guid><description>#course_cs50

A recursive function is a function that calls itself. [[Recursion]] is a powerful problem-solving technique: It allows us to tighten up our code and reduce the use of loops It also allows us to utilise the computer&amp;rsquo;s memory in an interesting way An example is the [[Search Algorithms#Binary search|binary search algorithm]] We can see that we use the keyword search in the last two conditions All the while, the inputs are getting cut in half until there is only one left 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 If no doors left Return false If 50 is behind doors[middle] Return true Else if 50 &amp;lt; doors[middle] Search doors[0] through doors[middle - 1] Else if 50 &amp;gt; doors[middle] Search doors[middle + 1] through doors[n - 1] First example Writing code to draw a pyramid of $n$ height: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 #include &amp;lt;cs50.</description></item><item><title>RGB</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/RGB/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/RGB/</guid><description>#course_cs50
This is one of the ways we can represent colours as a sequence of numbers.

Computer scientists tend to talk about the order of magnitude of the running time of an algorithm, as a function of the number of inputs We do away with most constants since we&amp;rsquo;re more interested in how much the runtime changes as the number of inputs increases This is called Big O Notation For example, an algorithm with a $O(n)$ runtime will increase in runtime linearly with the number of inputs provided to it.</description></item><item><title>scanf</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/scanf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/scanf/</guid><description>#course_cs50
