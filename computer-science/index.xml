We don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to track long lists of numbers in separate variables. An array is a chunk of memory storing values back to back; no gaps or fragmentation between the bytes.</description></item><item><title>ASCII</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/ASCII/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/ASCII/</guid><description>#course_cs50

base-2 Our everyday number system is a decimal-based (i.e. base-10) one. Take the number 123 for example, we can think of this as 1 in the 100s slot, 2 in the 10s slot, 3 in the 1s slot; adding them we get 123 Generalising this, each of those slots is 10 to the power of something: $100 = 10^2, 10 = 10^1, 1 = 10^0$ If we wanted to switch to a binary system, i.</description></item><item><title>C</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/C/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/C/</guid><description>#course_cs50 #C

Every C program has an exit status, a special return value from the program
By default, this is 0 if the process completed successfully Every other integer probably means something bad So far we&amp;rsquo;ve been writing main() with an int return value.</description></item><item><title>Linux Terminal</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Linux-Terminal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Linux-Terminal/</guid><description>#course_cs50 #linux #bash

If a machine can only read binary in the end, how is it reading our instructions? The code we write must be compiled into machine-readable format; which takes our source code, and converts into machine code.</description></item><item><title>Memory</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Memory/</guid><description>#course_cs50

Used to describe a code algorithm succinctly and accurately. We can break up the example pseudocode below into functions (verbs), control flow (if-else), boolean expressions, and loops.</description></item><item><title>Recursion</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/course-frontmatters/Recursion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/course-frontmatters/Recursion/</guid><description>#course_cs50
A recursive function is a function that calls itself. This is a powerful problem-solving technique: It allows us to tighten up our code and reduce the use of loops It also allows us to utilise the computer&amp;rsquo;s memory in an interesting way An example is the [[Search Algorithms#Binary search|binary search algorithm]] We can see that we use the keyword search in the last two conditions All the while, the inputs are getting cut in half until there is only one left 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 If no doors left Return false If 50 is behind doors[middle] Return true Else if 50 &amp;lt; doors[middle] Search doors[0] through doors[middle - 1] Else if 50 &amp;gt; doors[middle] Search doors[middle + 1] through doors[n - 1] First example Writing code to draw a pyramid of $n$ height: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 #include &amp;lt;cs50.</description></item><item><title>RGB</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/RGB/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/RGB/</guid><description>#course_cs50
This is one of the ways we can represent colours as a sequence of numbers. We can generate every colour of the rainbow by varying the amount of Red, Green, and Blue being displayed.</description></item><item><title>Running Time - O(n)</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/course-frontmatters/Running-Time-On/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/course-frontmatters/Running-Time-On/</guid><description>#course_cs50
Computer scientists tend to talk about the order of magnitude of the running time of an algorithm, as a function of the number of inputs We do away with most constants since we&amp;rsquo;re more interested in how much the runtime changes as the number of inputs increases This is called Big O Notation For example, an algorithm with a $O(n)$ runtime will increase in runtime linearly with the number of inputs provided to it.</description></item><item><title>Search Algorithms</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/course-frontmatters/Search-Algorithms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/course-frontmatters/Search-Algorithms/</guid><description>#course_cs50

Create a struct in C using the following syntax: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 typedef struct { // The contents of this data structure string name; string number; } person; // The name of the struct We can then do things like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // Define an array of person structs, pre-allocating 3 items person people[3]; // We then use `.</description></item><item><title>Unicode</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Unicode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Unicode/</guid><description>#course_cs50
Unicode is a superset of ASCII as we realised we need more bits to represent languages, emojis, etc. Unicode&amp;rsquo;s mission is to represent and preserve all human language both past, present, and future.</description></item><item><title>Unix Time</title><link>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Unix-Time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz/computer-science/Unix-Time/</guid><description>#course_cs50
